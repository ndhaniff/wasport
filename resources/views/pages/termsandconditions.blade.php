    <p>As with any GPS app or mobile data device, the accuracy of the location information shown on the tracking panel depends on, amongst other things, the quality of the connection between the Device and the GPS satellites and the connection with the mobile phone network.

The information on the tracking panel is therefore to be regarded as being a guide to the location of the Device at the time of the last update received from it, and subject to error. At best, the Device is accurate to around 5 meters. We do not warrant that the Service will be available always, as (in addition to the factors mentioned above), it may be down for maintenance or as a result of a fault. Accordingly, we cannot accept liability for any loss or damage incurred by you or any third-party app using your Device, arising from the Service or the Device, from any information displayed as part of the Service or from any unavailability of any of them. Use of the Device and the Service is not a substitute for proper care and supervision of the item to which the Device is attached. It is your responsibility to ensure you have any relevant insurance and to consider and decide whether the Device and Service are appropriate for your needs. We do not accept liability for death of or injury to any person caused by user’s own negligence. We do not accept liability for any indirect or consequential losses, or for loss of profit, business or revenue, whether direct or indirect. The usage of GPS routes is to showcase distance completed by user based upon results submitted as to ensure fair play among all users. If at any time we believe that you have broken these Terms or the terms of any other agreement with us or are using the Device or the Service improperly or illegally, we may terminate or suspect the provision of the Service immediately.
